**Please note, that `TREX` is currently under developoment.  More information will be added in due time.**

---

`TREX` allows to assimilate, process and analyse on sap flow data obtained with the thermal dissipation method (TDM). 
The package includes functions for gap filling time-series data, detecting outliers, calculating data-processing uncertainties and generating uniform data output and visualisation.
The package is designed to deal with large quantities of data and apply commonly used data-processing methods. 
The functions have been validated on data collected from different tree species across the northern hemisphere [Peters et al. 2018 <doi: 10.1111/nph.15241>)](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15241).
